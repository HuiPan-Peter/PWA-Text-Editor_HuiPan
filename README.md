  ## Description

  This application takes an existing text editor app and adds functionality for it to work as a PWA and function offline. The app is a single-page application that features a number of data persistance techniques that serve as redundancyies in the case one of the data storing options is not supported by the browser, and can function offline.

  The app functions as a text editor, allowing text to be entered, edited, and deleted, so start writing some code!
  * To save the code you have written into the database, just unfocus away from the app's current window. In other words, click on another tab, minimize the page, or click some space outside of the browser and the text will automatically save to the database and be reloaded on the page automatically on future visits.
  * If you would like to install the app and make it available on your local machine, just click the install button at the top-left of the page and then answer yes to the install prompt that appears. The app will be available on your taskbar for future use.
  * If you would like to uninstall the app, open the installed app, navigate to the upper-right-hand corner of the window to the three vertical dots, and choose the option 'Uninstall Just Another Text Editor'.
  * The app is also available offline, enabling you to utilize the text editor even without an internet connection!
